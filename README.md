# Rcoket-Design-App---Samara---Space-Engineering-and-technology-internship---Winter-Space-School

Can't be proud more to share with you that I have successfully  finished my "space engineering and technology" at Samara University. The internship was part of winter space school.

The internship was one of the most valuable learning experiences I have ever had. The course actually covered a lot of space engineering technologies, and we build a group project which aimed to (make the design and the ballistic optimization of the EPS spacecraft for interplanetary mission from the earth to venus with initial mass ùëö0=1500 kg). we also build a control circuit and a mobile app which makes calculation easier. With my great team we really achieved a great success in our project.

Finally I would like to thank EgSA-Egyptian Space Agency , Samara University for this great opportunity. I would like also like to thank my awesome team for their constant effort during the whole journey.
